# Omniscent

**Omniscent**, originally created by demogroup **Sanction**, is the 1st in the *Mekka & Symposium 1997 PC 4K Intro Competition*.
It is a MS-DOS demoscene that demonstrates an fascinating 3D animation with MIDI music, in just 4095 bytes!

The goal of this project is to analyze *Omniscent* and replicate it with TypeScript, explaining its principles and making it possible to run on modern browsers. You can experience the demo at <https://supersodasea.github.io/Omniscent/>.

The original version of *Omniscent* can be found at <https://files.scene.org/view/demos/groups/sanction/snc_omni.zip>. You can experience it in an emulator such as DOSBox.
